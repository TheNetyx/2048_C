2048, written in C because why not

This is probably some very not optimal code, but hey, it works (??). It looks
pretty bad since it's just black and white and that makes it kinda difficult
to tell a cell with 2 from one with 4 like you can with the real 2048. Might
update this later if I feel like it :p

Dependencies:
- ncurses
